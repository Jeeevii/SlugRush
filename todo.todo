TODO: 
    - make separate db table for storing averages of all weeks (use this for populating weekly view)
    - delete weekly view entries once average of day is calculated and stored(?) - will increase data storage limits exponentially
    - cache weekly view for 1 day, to avoid component re ping every visit
    - modify ap scheduler for pings only during operation hours (limit backend hosting hours used)
    - understand render slow start to optimize calls
    - lazy load weekly view(? unless itâ€™s already lazy loaded) 

extras/good practice:
    - mess with redis caching for backend (weekly endpoint, daily endpoint, status bar)
    - local storage/or ??? caching for frontend
    - cache weekly view locally for 5 hours
    - cache daily view for 30 minutes (update if backend changes)
    - cache status bar view for 5 minutes (or update if backend changes)
