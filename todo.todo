# âœ… SlugRush Project TODO

## ðŸ”„ Current Work
Weekly Count System:
    [x] Create new table for storing calculated weekly averages  
    [x] Create new task/job for updating weekly averages (once a week)  
    [] Modify `get_weekly_query` to return weekly averages from new table  
    [] Modify `/weekly` endpoint logic to fetch data from new table  
    [] Modify APScheduler to update `weekly_counts` with daily averages  
    [] Cache weekly view data for 1 day to prevent re-pings on every visit  

## ðŸš€ SlugRush Full Release Prep

Backend Tasks:
    [x] APScheduler only runs during gym hours (saves hosting time)  
    [] Delete old weekly view entries after average is stored (storage concerns)  
    [] Optimize APScheduler cold start performance (Render slow start)  

Frontend Tasks:
    [x] Lazy load weekly view (confirmed working)  
    [] Add frontend caching (e.g., localStorage) for:  
        [] Weekly view (5 hrs?)  
        [] Daily view (30 mins?)  
        [] Status bar (5 mins?)  
    [] Maybe add subtle UI/UX animations for key features  

Design Refresh (New Branding):
    [] Update app icon with new project logo (all devices)  
    [] Replace background image (ensure it scales cleanly)  
    [] Replace project logo on all pages  
    [] Update title  
    [] Update description  
    [] Update favicon  
    [] Update color scheme  
    [] Update font  
    [] Update layout  


## ðŸ§¼ Nice-to-Haves / Extras
Stretch Goals/ Good Practices:
    [] Redis backend caching for:  
        [] Weekly endpoint  
        [] Daily endpoint  
        [] Status bar  
    [] Add toggle or setting for enabling/disabling local caching (UX bonus)
