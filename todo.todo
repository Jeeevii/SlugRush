# TODO List for SlugRush Project
## Current Tasks
Weekly Count Table:
    [x] Create new table for storing calculated weekly averages
    [x] Create new task/job for updating weekly averages (once a week)
    [] Modify `get_weekly_query` to return weekly averages from new table
    [] Modify weekly endpoint logic for fetching weekly averages from new table


## Overall Project Tasks
SlugRush Full Release:
    [] Make separate DB table for storing averages of all weeks (used for populating weekly view)
    [] Delete weekly view entries after weekly average is calculated (storage concerns)
    [] Cache weekly view for 1 day to avoid re-ping on every visit
    [x] Modify APScheduler to only ping during gym operation hours (saves hosting hours)
    [] Understand Render slow start & optimize cold start calls
    [x] Lazy load weekly view (confirm it's working)


## Good Practices/New to Implement
Extras/Stretch Goals:
    [] Redis caching for backend: weekly, daily, and status endpoints
    [] Frontend caching (localStorage or other)
    [] Cache weekly view locally for 5 hours
    [] Cache daily view for 30 minutes (update on backend change)
    [] Cache status bar view for 5 minutes (or update on backend change)
