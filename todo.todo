# âœ… SlugRush Project TODO

## ðŸ”„ Current Work
Weekly Count System:
    [x] Create new table for storing calculated weekly averages  
    [x] Create new task/job for updating weekly averages (once a week)  
    [x] Modify `get_weekly_query` to return weekly averages from new table  
    [x] Modify `get/weekly` endpoint logic to fetch data from new table  
    [x] Modify APScheduler to update `weekly_counts` with daily averages  
    [] Cache weekly view data for 1 day to prevent re-pings on every visit  
    [] Unit tests for new weekly averages logic (if time allows)  
    [] Set up React Native to wrap app in WebView for IOS/Android app
    [] Basic Pop Up linking to the app store for IOS/Android app (using local storage to not show again)  
    [] 
    
## ðŸš€ SlugRush Full Release Prep
Backend Tasks:
    [x] APScheduler only runs during gym hours (saves hosting time)  
    [] Delete old weekly view entries after average is stored (storage concerns) - needed? or delete oldest week once 3 months is stored? 
    [x] Optimize APScheduler cold start performance (Render slow start)  

Frontend Tasks:
    [x] Lazy load weekly view (confirmed working)  
    [] Add frontend caching (e.g., localStorage) for:  
        [] Weekly view (5 hrs?)  
        [] Daily view (30 mins?)  
        [] Status bar (5 mins?)  
    [] Maybe add subtle UI/UX animations for key features  

Design Refresh (New Branding):
    [x] Update app icon with new project logo (all devices)  
    [x] Replace background image (ensure it scales cleanly)  
    [] Small UI/UX tweaks for consistency with new branding 


## ðŸ§¼ Nice-to-Haves / Extras
Stretch Goals/ Good Practices:
    [] Redis backend caching for:  
        [] Weekly endpoint  
        [] Daily endpoint  
        [] Status bar  
    [] Add toggle or setting for enabling/disabling local caching (UX bonus)
